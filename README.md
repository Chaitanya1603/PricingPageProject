Project Overview: Gym Membership Management System

Introduction:
The Gym Membership Management System is a web-based application that allows users to explore and choose different gym membership plans based on their preferences. The system provides information about various membership options, including pricing, features, and benefits. Users can select their desired membership plan and, in some cases, choose the billing frequency and duration.

Key Features:

Membership Plans:

Basic Plan: Provides access to standard gym facilities, standard workout equipment, and operates during regular gym hours. No personal trainer is included.
Premium Plan: Offers enhanced features, including access to premium workout equipment, personal trainer sessions, and more flexible operating hours.
VIP Plan: Tailored for exclusive members with VIP access to all facilities, customized workout plans, and 24/7 gym access.
Billing Options:

Users can choose between annual and monthly billing options using a toggle switch. The prices are dynamically updated based on the selected billing frequency.
Membership Duration:

For monthly plans, users can select the duration of their membership, such as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months. The total price is adjusted based on the chosen duration.
Currency Conversion:

The system considers the exchange rate to convert prices from USD to INR for display purposes. Users in India can view prices in Indian Rupees.
Interactive UI:

The user interface (UI) is interactive, allowing users to toggle between billing frequencies and select membership durations. Prices are dynamically updated without the need for page refresh.
Responsive Design:

The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
